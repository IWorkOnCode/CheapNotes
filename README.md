# CheapNotes

This program is based on the example found in https://javaquizplayer.com/examples/notesapp-using-swing-h2database-JPA-example.html#Build_the_GUI, and created with Java Eclipse, but with some modifications to the visual design like font and widgets, and made to use a different database system entirely in the form of SQLite. To set the program up, create a local database with SQLite, and change the connect_url to the path leading to said database. Then, run MainFile.java.
